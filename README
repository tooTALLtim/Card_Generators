Hi!

My friends and I like playing Cards Against Humanity (http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).  We got together one night and wrote down a bunch of ideas for our own cards.  My friend Piper, who got me into Python, challenged me to write a program to generate cards!

I had almost no idea how to do so, but after he introduced me to Pillow and got me started in the right direction, I got going!  About a week or so later, I learned quite a bit about Pillow, and how it interacts with Python.  I didn't know that we were going to use an online printing service (in this case Printer Studio (http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/bridge-size-custom-cards-blank-cards.html)) to print them out, so I have three different programs that represent two ways of printing cards.

###
Install Pillow and it's libraries to make these programs work.  Pillow will not run if you have PIL installed.
###

make_individual_cards:
    This program assumes the user has saved their lists of black and white cards
    in the working directory of the script, and labled them "List_whites.txt" 
    and "List_blacks.txt".  The program starts by prompting the user whether
    they would like to make black or white cards.  It then runs through the
    associated file and generates .png images appropriate to uploading to
    Printer Studio to create "bridge size" cards.  The logo is sized at
    120x120 pixels.
    
make_card_backs:
    This program makes the back image of the card.  It allows for either a 
    black or white background.
    
home_printable_cards:
    This program takes all of the lines from the file chosen, makes small
    images of each, and pastes them onto a larger image that is
    4 images x 5 images. This is the program to use if you're printing
    out cards on a home (or Kinko's) printer.  This uses the code from 
    make_individual_cards, so refer to that one for comments and 
    explanations on the simple card generation. These cards have borders
    around them to make cutting them out easier, so take that into 
    consideration when calculating total dimensions and paste coordinates. 
    Be forewarned, it takes a while to cut out all the cards!
