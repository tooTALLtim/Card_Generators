Hi!

My friends and I like playing Cards Against Humanity (http://cardsagainsthumanity.com/).  We got together one night and wrote down a bunch of ideas for our own cards.  My friend Piper, who got me into Python, challenged me to write a program to generate cards!

I had almost no idea how to do so, but after he introduced me to Pillow and got me started in the right direction, I got going!  About a week or so later, I learned quite a bit about Pillow, and how it interacts with Python.  I didn't know that we were going to use an online printing studio(in this case Printer Studio (http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/bridge-size-custom-cards-blank-cards.html)) to print them out, so I have a few different card generators that can be used in different ways.

###
Install Pillow and it's libraries to make these programs work.  Pillow will not run if you have PIL installed.

make_individual_cards:
    This program assumes the user has saved their lists of black and white cards
    in the working directory of the script, and labled them "List_whites.txt" and 
    "List_blacks.txt".  The program starts by prompting the user whether they 
    would like to make black or white cards.  It then runs through the associated
    file and generates .png images appropriate to uploading to Printer Studio
    to create "bridge size" cards.  The logo is sized at 120x120 pixels.
